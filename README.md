# Workshops from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) <br />

This repository contains the material corresponding to the workshop/Hands-on: _Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++_ . The objectives are:

1. **Present** quickly and objectively concepts of Code Portability and Optimization;
2. **Show** through simple examples the use of Parallel and Distributed Programming in GPU systems;
3. **Expose** students to applicability in case studies.

Material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. The first notebook is structured for execution in Google Collab:

## [GPU-enabled-C_C++applications-CUDA.ipynb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kW2qPsXEqt56m96DgTn32OFMwQOTCpyd/view?usp=share_link)
The introductory notebook contains some of the webinar's content, and through some basic commands, we will be able to characterize the available CUDA execution environment.
